# GameOfLife

John Horton Conway was a British mathematician who created the 'Game of Life,' a cellular automaton in 1970. The game is determined by its initial state and represents a grid of cells where each cell can be either alive or dead. The grid evolves based on simple rules. The Game of Life has significantly influenced computer science, mathematics, biology, and various other fields. It has fascinated and inspired generations of mathematicians and scientists.
